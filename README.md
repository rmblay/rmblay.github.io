Here to showcase what repositories I'm working on
This respository was created to show case how to clone a GitHub page repository and add website files to the local repository folder
After creating an account, I first created a repository with a README file. I then downloaded the desktop version of GitHub. Clicking on the '+' symbol in the top left corner, I was able to clone my repository onto my hardrive.
